# Procedural programming Tasks
Welcome to my collection of procedural programming tasks in C! Each week, I tackled a new challenge designed to test my problem-solving abilities and strengthen my understanding of procedural programming concepts in C.

In this repository, you'll find the solutions I came up with for each task, along with the original problem descriptions. 

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use the challenges in your own learning journey. Happy coding!
